# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — 4-Module Technical Book (Meta-Spec)

**Feature Branch**: `main`
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Aggregation of individual module specifications.

## Purpose

This meta-specification outlines the overarching purpose and scope for the entire 4-module technical book titled "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." The book aims to provide a comprehensive educational resource for beginner-to-intermediate readers on building intelligent humanoid robots through a structured curriculum covering fundamental robotics frameworks, simulation environments, AI integration, and advanced vision-language-action pipelines.

## Overall Scope

The book will cover the following key areas, each detailed in its respective module specification:

-   **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Fundamentals of ROS 2, nodes, topics, services, actions, and URDF-based humanoid models.
-   **Module 2: The Digital Twin — Gazebo & Unity Simulation Environments**: Digital Twin development using Gazebo and Unity, physics simulation, sensor modeling, and environment creation.
-   **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain — NVIDIA Isaac Simulation and Isaac ROS**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, perception, VSLAM, navigation, synthetic data, and photorealistic simulation.
-   **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robotics**: VLA pipelines, voice commands, LLM reasoning, object detection, and action generation for humanoid robots.
