# Lab 6: Isaac Sim Advanced Scenarios

## Overview
This lab demonstrates advanced Isaac Sim scenarios including multi-robot coordination and complex manipulation tasks. You'll learn how to implement sophisticated robotics applications in simulation.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up multi-robot environments
- Implement coordination algorithms
- Execute complex manipulation sequences
- Handle failure detection and recovery

## Files
- `isaac_advanced_scenarios.py`: Advanced scenarios implementation

## Theory
Advanced robotics scenarios involve multiple agents working together, complex task execution, and robust error handling. These scenarios test the full capabilities of robotic systems.

## Implementation
The implementation includes:
- Multi-robot environment setup
- Coordination task execution
- Complex manipulation with multiple steps
- Failure detection and recovery simulation

## Running the Demo
```bash
python isaac_advanced_scenarios.py
```

## Exercises
1. Implement a more complex multi-robot task (e.g., formation control)
2. Add human-robot interaction scenarios
3. Create a scenario with dynamic obstacles and replanning
