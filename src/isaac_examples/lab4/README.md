# Lab 4: Isaac Sim Terrain Generation

## Overview
This lab demonstrates terrain generation and environment creation in Isaac Sim. You'll learn how to create various types of environments from simple flat terrains to complex indoor and outdoor scenes.

## Learning Objectives
- Generate different types of terrains (flat, rough, natural)
- Create indoor environments with walls and furniture
- Build outdoor environments with natural features
- Understand environment design principles

## Files
- `isaac_terrain_generation.py`: Terrain generation implementation

## Theory
Realistic environment simulation is crucial for robotics testing. Different terrains and environments provide various challenges for navigation, perception, and control algorithms.

## Implementation
The implementation includes:
- Flat terrain creation for basic navigation
- Rough terrain with obstacles
- Indoor environment with rooms and furniture
- Outdoor environment with natural features

## Running the Demo
```bash
python isaac_terrain_generation.py
```

## Exercises
1. Create a warehouse environment with shelves and aisles
2. Add dynamic obstacles that move during simulation
3. Implement terrain with varying friction properties
