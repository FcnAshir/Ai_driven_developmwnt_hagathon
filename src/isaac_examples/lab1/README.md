# Lab 1: Isaac Sim Basic Setup

## Overview
This lab introduces the basic setup and initialization of Isaac Sim for robotics simulation. You'll learn how to create a basic environment with ground plane, lighting, and a simple robot model.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up an Isaac Sim environment
- Create basic scene elements (ground, lighting)
- Initialize a simple robot model
- Configure physics properties

## Files
- `isaac_basic_setup.py`: Basic Isaac Sim environment setup

## Theory
Isaac Sim is NVIDIA's robotics simulation environment built on the Omniverse platform. It provides realistic physics simulation, sensor simulation, and rendering capabilities for robotics development and testing.

## Implementation
The implementation includes:
- Environment setup with ground plane and lighting
- Basic robot model creation
- Physics configuration (gravity, etc.)

## Running the Demo
```bash
python isaac_basic_setup.py
```

## Exercises
1. Add more complex geometry to the environment
2. Create a more detailed robot model
3. Experiment with different physics properties
