# Lab 5: Isaac Sim AI Integration

## Overview
This lab demonstrates integration of AI models with Isaac Sim for perception and control. You'll learn how to connect AI pipelines with simulation for training and testing.

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate perception models with Isaac Sim
- Connect control algorithms to simulation
- Implement learning pipelines with simulation feedback
- Understand AI-simulation workflows

## Files
- `isaac_ai_integration.py`: AI integration implementation

## Theory
AI integration with simulation enables training and testing of machine learning models in safe, controlled environments. This includes perception models for object detection and control models for robot behavior.

## Implementation
The implementation includes:
- Perception pipeline processing camera data
- Control pipeline generating robot commands
- Learning pipeline for reinforcement learning
- AI-simulation integration demonstration

## Running the Demo
```bash
python isaac_ai_integration.py
```

## Exercises
1. Integrate a real object detection model (YOLO, etc.)
2. Implement a reinforcement learning agent
3. Create a closed-loop perception-control system
