# Lab 2: Isaac Sim Robot Control

## Overview
This lab demonstrates robot control in Isaac Sim, including joint control and Cartesian movement. You'll learn how to command robot movements and control articulation.

## Learning Objectives
- Control robot joints in Isaac Sim
- Perform Cartesian position control
- Understand robot kinematics in simulation
- Execute robot movement commands

## Files
- `isaac_robot_control.py`: Robot control implementation

## Theory
Robot control in Isaac Sim involves commanding joint positions, velocities, or torques to achieve desired movements. This includes both position control for precise positioning and Cartesian control for end-effector positioning.

## Implementation
The implementation includes:
- Joint position and velocity control
- Cartesian movement with inverse kinematics
- Robot control demonstration

## Running the Demo
```bash
python isaac_robot_control.py
```

## Exercises
1. Add trajectory planning for smooth movements
2. Implement force control capabilities
3. Create a teleoperation interface
