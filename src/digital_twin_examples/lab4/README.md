# Unity ROS Bridge Package

This package provides the necessary components to connect ROS 2 with Unity for digital twin applications.

## Overview

The Unity ROS Bridge enables bidirectional communication between ROS 2 and Unity, allowing for high-fidelity visualization of robotics simulations. This package includes:

- Unity bridge node for TCP communication
- SDF world files for Gazebo simulation
- URDF robot model for the humanoid robot
- Launch files for easy setup
- Documentation for Unity integration

## Components

### Unity Bridge Node (`unity_bridge_node.py`)
- Establishes TCP connection to Unity
- Subscribes to ROS topics (joint states, sensors, etc.)
- Publishes data to Unity via TCP
- Handles real-time synchronization

### SDF World (`worlds/unity_export_world.sdf`)
- Complex environment with room structure, furniture, and humanoid robot
- Includes visual and collision properties
- Ready for Unity export

### URDF Robot Model (`urdf/humanoid_robot.urdf`)
- Complete humanoid robot model with joints and links
- Includes sensors (camera, LiDAR)
- Physics properties for simulation

## Usage

### 1. Build the Package
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select unity_ros_bridge
source install/setup.bash
```

### 2. Launch the Simulation
```bash
ros2 launch unity_ros_bridge unity_bridge.launch.py
```

### 3. Connect Unity
1. Set up Unity project with ROS-TCP-Connector
2. Configure connection to localhost:10000
3. Import robot model and synchronize transforms

## Unity Integration

The package includes documentation for Unity integration:
- `unity_setup_guide.md` - Complete setup guide
- `unity_import_guide.md` - Generated by export_meshes.py

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Unity and ROS are on the same network
- Check TCP port configuration (default: 10000)
- Verify robot model paths are correct
- Monitor console for connection errors
