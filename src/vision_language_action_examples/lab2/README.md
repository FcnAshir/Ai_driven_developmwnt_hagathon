# Lab 2: Advanced Vision-Language-Action System

## Overview
This lab builds on Lab 1 to implement a more sophisticated VLA system with advanced vision processing, spatial reasoning, and action planning.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement advanced vision processing with spatial relationships
- Add spatial reasoning capabilities to language understanding
- Create more sophisticated action planning algorithms
- Understand real-time processing concepts

## Files
- `advanced_vla_system.py`: Advanced VLA implementation with spatial reasoning

## Theory
Advanced VLA systems incorporate:
1. **Spatial Reasoning**: Understanding relationships between objects
2. **Context Awareness**: Using spatial context in language understanding
3. **Path Planning**: Sophisticated navigation planning
4. **Real-time Processing**: Efficient processing for interactive systems

## Implementation
The advanced VLA system includes:
- Vision processor with spatial relationship analysis
- Language processor with spatial understanding
- Action planner with path planning capabilities
- Threading for real-time processing

## Running the Demo
```bash
python3 advanced_vla_system.py
```

## Exercises
1. Add more sophisticated spatial relationship detection
2. Implement semantic scene understanding
3. Add obstacle avoidance to the path planning
4. Create a more natural language interface
