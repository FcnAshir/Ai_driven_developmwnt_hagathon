# Lab 1: Introduction to VLA Systems

## Objective

In this lab, you will learn the basics of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems by implementing a simple voice command to robot action pipeline.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of speech recognition concepts
- Completion of previous modules
- Access to microphone and audio processing capabilities

## Tasks

1. Set up speech recognition using Whisper or similar technology
2. Process voice commands and convert to text
3. Implement basic natural language understanding
4. Map commands to simple robot actions
5. Execute actions in simulation

## Overview

This lab introduces you to Vision-Language-Action systems, which integrate perception, language understanding, and action execution for natural human-robot interaction.

## Steps

### Step 1: Speech Recognition Setup

Configure speech-to-text processing for voice commands.

### Step 2: Language Processing

Implement basic natural language understanding for command interpretation.

### Step 3: Action Mapping

Map understood commands to specific robot actions.

### Step 4: Execution

Execute the actions in a simulated environment.

## Expected Outcome

You should have a working system that can accept voice commands and execute corresponding robot actions.

## Troubleshooting

- Check audio input and processing capabilities
- Verify speech recognition accuracy
- Ensure proper command-to-action mapping

## Next Steps

This lab provides the foundation for more complex VLA systems in subsequent labs.
