# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about building intelligent humanoid robots using modern robotics frameworks and AI technologies.

## About This Book

This book is structured as a 4-module technical course that progresses from fundamental concepts to integrated systems:

1. **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2. **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity Simulation)
3. **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac Simulation and Isaac ROS)
4. **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robotics

Each module is designed to be independently completable and testable, with hands-on labs and practical tutorials.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Robotics engineers and researchers
- AI and machine learning practitioners
- Software developers interested in robotics
- Students studying robotics or AI
- Anyone interested in building intelligent humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)

## How to Use This Book

Each module follows a consistent structure:
1. Introduction and learning outcomes
2. Core concepts and architecture
3. Deep technical foundation
4. Practical tutorials and hands-on labs
5. Application to humanoid robotics
6. Debugging and troubleshooting
7. Assessment criteria
8. Summary and further reading

## Hardware Requirements

The book supports both physical and simulated environments. See the [Hardware Appendix](/docs/hardware-appendix) for detailed requirements.
